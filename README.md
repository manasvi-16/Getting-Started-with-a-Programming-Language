# Getting-Started-with-a-Programming-Language
 
Starting as a beginner in a programming world can be very overwhelming. There are so many things to learn about. Bundles of free resources are available for you. Yet it is really difficult to figure out how and where exactly to start and where to head first? Whether you should start with buying a book or reading blog posts would be enough. Should you take an online course or not. You will encounter several such questions.

It will cost you so many hours to browse through websites, blog posts, youtube videos, and LinkedIn handles of successful people but you might end up without any clue. 

The world of programming is quite huge and dynamic. It is easy to get lost without a purpose in it. And the feelings of overwhelm and misery comes rolling with that. It is fine to explore things but you don’t even realize when you get flooded with so much information.

Getting started with programming can be fun if you know the roadmap to learn it and it is not that difficult. Here I will help you with a general roadmap of learning a language that you can use as a beginner.
## Getting Started
Before you start reading about anything figure out what language you want to learn. Browsing without a niche will kill your precious time. Instead, try to figure out where exactly does this language stands currently. Is it in demand? Or are there exciting opportunities available for you after acquiring this skill? Or you are just starting with this because you are interested in it. Whether you are passionate or curious anything works. 
The first step to get started is to know the language you want to learn.

Once you know the language start researching about it. More precisely start with learning the history of the language. When was it developed? Who was the developer and so on. Try to get this information from reliable websites and books. 
This will help you understand the roots and history of the language and will enhance your curiosity. 

Let’s say you are starting with the C language then you should search about the history of C. 

After getting a little familiar with the language. Look for the software you might need to write programs. Don’t get too excited! There is a lot you need to read and learn before you start writing your program. But installing the software will be good to start with. Make sure to check the applications and trends of the language you are starting with.

There are plenty of freebies and tutorials available on the internet to help you install the desired software. 

**Pro-tip: If you don’t have a new laptop or resources which is absolutely fine. See the requirements of the software you are about to install. Usually, the updated versions of the software are not compatible with the outdated OS versions. Make sure to see the compatibility of the software version before installing it.**

For example, Windows Ultimate 7 and previous versions do not support the current version of python.

##  Basics 101
Basics of language work as a foundation for any programming language. But don’t try to grasp it all in one go. As a beginner, you might need some time to get along with all the new information as well as the new terminology. It is absolutely fine to go at your own pace. 

Here are the basics that you might need to head on first if you are an absolute beginner  -
* Starting with variables, constants, keywords, and functions.

* Data types - Integer, Characters, strings, etc.

* Operators - Arithmetic, Logical, and hierarchy of operators.

* Decision making - if-else, nested if-else.

* Complex Decision making loops - for loop, while loop, Do-while loop


Don’t get overwhelmed you don’t need to start learning this from scratch every time you pick up a language. Just get through this once and then brushing up the basics once in a while will do. But as someone just starting you should learn the basics. These basics will add to your knowledge but will also help you start with simple programs as well.

When you start with the topics like operators and decision making you will encounter programs along with theory. You can use these examples to practice writing programs. 
Apart from that, you can refer to a book like “Getting started with C” by Yashwant Kanetkar. It has everything that you might need to get started. 

Although you don’t necessarily need a book to learn a language. You can leverage free resources to learn and grow.


**Pro-tip: Don’t try to skip basics even if you don’t like it at first or find it difficult to grasp. Getting started with something can be difficult and it’s okay. Basics are important and they will help you pave your path into programming. 
If just reading about these topics is not enough you can refer to youtube tutorials as well.**

These topics are not the only ones in the bag of basics you can scale up to topics like functions, methods, structures, strings, arrays, and so on. 

## Practice, Practice, and More Practice
The world of programming is very dynamic. It keeps on changing and there is always so much left to learn. Whether you are a beginner or an expert. Everyone needs to constantly practice and revise things that they’ve learned so far. 

Practicing will never harm you. In fact, brushing up on your basics will get you an even more clear idea of where you started. To practice writing programs, there are plenty of websites that provide questions along with solutions. You can explore different websites for the same. 

Diving into theory is all good but don't get too caught up by it. Unless you implement what you learn in theory you won’t find it interesting. Try to use your knowledge in creating programs on your own. Or try to find where you can implement what you just learned. 

You won’t become an expert overnight. You don’t even need to be one as soon as you start. Things take time, in your journey, you will see many people who have much more experience and knowledge. Don’t compare yourself at any moment it will push you in the spiral of self-sabotage.

Your journey is unique and you own it.
